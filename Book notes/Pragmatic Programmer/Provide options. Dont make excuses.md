# Provide options. Dont make excuses 

Part of [[Pragmatic Phillosophy]]. 

Evaluate risk. Communicate them. Accept or not. If you accept then you are accountable for them. Do not blame others. Before you explaining something to others (e.g. failure) listen to yourself. Does it sound lame? Instead of explaining failure offer an option or a solution. Explain what can be done to mitigate the damage or resolve difficult situation.

# Invest regularly in your knowledge portfolio

  

From  [[Pragmatic Phillosophy]].  Learn at least one language every year. Read a technical book each quarter. Read non-technical books too. Take classes. Focus first on things you know in order to master and the ones you need to use in project. Then move to new technologies. Participate in local user groups. Experiment with different environments ( different os, ide, framework, build system) to know other approaches. Stay current. Get wired ( social media, blogs and so on). Constantly invest in your knowledge.

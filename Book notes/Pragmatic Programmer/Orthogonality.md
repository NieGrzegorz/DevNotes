# Orthogonality 

Idea connected to the tip [[Make it easy to reuse]]. 

Independence and decoupling. Two or more things are orthogonal if changes in one do not affect others. Orthogonality increases productivity since decoupled modules enchance reusability. Also it reduces risk since self-contained components do not spread the symptoms to other parts of system. Also it is easier to work on a single component to fix it. Also components are easier to test. You wont tie your code with 3rd party vendors if you communicate via interfaces.

# Basic terms 

# The Internet
[[The Internet]] is a computer network that connects billions of computing devices called [[hosts]] or [[end systems]]. End systems are connected together by a network of [[communucation links]] and [[packet switches]]. 

The Internet may be defined also as an infrastructure that provides services to applications. This applications are said to be distributed applications since they involve 


### Packet switch
A packet switch takes a packet arriving on one of its incomming communication links. Most popular packet switches in today's internet are [[routers]] and [[link-layer switches]]. Both types of switches forward packets towards their ultimate destinations. 
[[Communication link]]

Route or path is the sequence of communication links and packet switches traversed bt a packed from the sending end system to the reciving end system. 

[[Internet Service Provider]]

### Protocol 
End systems, packet switches and other pieces of the Internet run protocols that control the sending and receiving of information withing the Internet. The most important ones are [[Transmission Control Protocol]] and [[Internet Protocol]].

### Request for comment  (RFC)
The Internet standards are developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force. Their documents are called requests for comments. They define the protocols and other network stuff

"A protocol defines the format and the order of messages exchanged between two or more communicating entities, as well as the actions taken on the transmission and/or receipt of a message or other event"

End systems attached to the[[Socket interface]] that specifies how a program running on one of end systems asks the Internet infrastructure to deliver data to a specific destination program running on another end system.


### How homes connect to the Internet? 
Digital subscriber line (DSL) and cable. 
#### DSL
A household usually obtains DSL Internet access from the same lical telephone company (telco) that provudes its wired local phone access. So if DSL is used a customers telco is also its ISP. 

In this case, each DSL modem uses the existing telephone line ti exchange data with a digital subscriber line access multiplexer (DSLAM) located in telco's central office. DSL modem takes digital data and transates it to high-frequency tones for transmission over telephone wires. These are translated back to digital format at the DSLAM. 

"Engineers have expressly designed DSL for short distances between the home and the CO; generally, if the residence is not located within 5 to 10 miles of the CO, the residence must resort to an alternative form of Internet access."

#### Cable Internet access
Uses the same infrastructure from cable television provider. 

Fiber and coaxial cables are used called hybrid fiber coax (HFC)
- Requires special modems called cable modems

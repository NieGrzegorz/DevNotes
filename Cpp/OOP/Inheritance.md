# Inheritance 
One of four pillars of [[OOP|Object Oriented Programming]]. 

"The concept does not live in isolation, it coexists with related concepts.(...) Since classes are used to represent concepts the issue is how to represent relations" - Bjarne

### What is Inheritance

Inheritance is a language mechanism to represent relations between classes, that is, to express the commonalities between classes. 

### Types of inheritance 
* Implementation inheritance -> to save implementation effort by sharing facilities provided by a base class. 
* Interface inheritance -> to allow different derived classes to be used interchangebly through the onterface provided by base class (see [[Polymorphism]]). 

Derived class is never smaller (usually larger) than base class. 

No memory overhead is required by deriving a class. Space required by an object created is a space of its members. 

### Multiple inheritance 

#### Diamond problem
Happens when a class inherits traits of a super class twice.

# Polymorphism 

One of four pillars of [[OOP | Object oriented programming]]. 

Dispatching - finding right method to call.  
Late binding, dynamic binding, dynamic dispatch - runtime plymorphism 
		It happens when virtual keyword is used in method declaration, cpp creates virtual table which is look-up table for calling such methods 
	
	
Early binding - compile time polymorphism - method overloading 


VTABLE is mechanism to support late binding.

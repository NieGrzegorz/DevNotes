# Polymorphism 

One of four pillars of [[OOP | Object oriented programming]]. 

Dispatching - finding right method to call.  
Late binding, dynamic binding, dynamic dispatch - runtime plymorphism 
It happens when virtual keyword is used in method declaration, cpp creates virtual table which is look-up table for calling such methods 
	
Early binding - compile time polymorphism - method overloading 

### Binding and dispatching
Dispatching means finding right method to call. 

Late binding, dynamic binding, dynamic dispatch, runtime plymorphism - it happens when virtual keyword is used in method declaration, cpp creates virtual table which is look-up table for calling such methods. 
		
Early dispatch, early binding, static binding, compile-time polymorphism - it happens when we define two different functions with the same name but with different number/type of arguments. 

### Virtual table 
Polymorphism in C++ is implemented by means of Virtual Table or VTABLE.

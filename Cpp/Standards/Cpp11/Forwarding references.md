# Forwarding references 
One of the [[C++11 Language features]]. 
   

Forwarding (universal references)

Forwarding reference is created by syntax T&& or auto&&. Enables move semantics and perfect forwarding (the ability to pass both rvalues and lvalues)

Forwarding references allows a reference to bind to either rvalue or lvalue.

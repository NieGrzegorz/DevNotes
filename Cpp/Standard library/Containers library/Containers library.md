# Containers library 

Containers library contains collection of class templates and algorithms that can be used to implement common data structures. 

### Sequence containers 
Data structures that can be accessed sequencially 

* [[array]]
* [[vector]]
* [[list]]
* [[forward_list]]
* [[deque]]

### Associative containers 
Sorted data structures that can be searched quickly O(log n) complexity
* [[set]]
* [[map]]
* [[multiset]]
* [[multimap]]

### Unordered assiociative containers 

### Container adaptors

# Big O notation 
Back to [[Content]]. 


## Definition 
Metric to describe the efficiency of algotithms. 

## Runtime examples 
## Time complexity 
### Big O, Big Theta and Big Omega
- **O** (Big O): describes an upper bound on the time. If algorithm is described as O(n) then the algorithm is at least as fast as this therefore this is an upper bound on the runtime. This is the equivalent to less-than-or-equal-to relationship.
- **Ω**(Big Omega): describes a lower bound on the time. If runtime is Ω(n) it means that is won't be faster than that. 
- **θ**(Big Theta) : Means both O and Ω. If algorithm is θ(N) then it is both O(n) and Ω(N). θ gives a tight bound on runtime. 

In industry people use big O as θ. 

### Best case, worst case and expected case

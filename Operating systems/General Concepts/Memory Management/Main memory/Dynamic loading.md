# Dynamic loading 

Part of [[Basic information]]
Dynamic loading causes the routine to be not loaded until it is called. All routines are kept on disk in relocatable format. It DOES NOT require special support from operating system. It is responsibility of a user to design programs to take advantage of this method.

# Contiguous memory allocation

Part of [[Main memory]]

   

Early method of memory allocation before paging. The MAIN MEMORY is divided into two partitions:

-   One for oprating system (either high or low memory addresses - the decission depends on many factor such as the location of the interrupt vector). Linux and Windows place the OS in HIGH memory addresses.
-   Second partition is for user processes. We want many processes to work in memory at the same time.

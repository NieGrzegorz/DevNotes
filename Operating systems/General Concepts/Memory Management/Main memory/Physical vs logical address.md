# Physical vs Logical addresses
Part of [[Basic information]]
* **Physical address** - Address seen by Memory Unit - the one loaded to **MEMORY ADDRESS REGISTER**
* **Logical address** - Address generated by the CPU is called **LOGICAL ADDRESS**

**BINDING** of addresses at compile time or load time generates identical logical and physical addresses.

Execution-time binging results in different logical and physicaladdresses. That is why we call the logical address a **VIRTUAL ADDRESS**. Program produces logical addresses which is called a **LOGICAL ADDRESS SPACE**.

   

The mapping in run-time is handled by a hardware called Memory Management Unit (MMU).

The base register is now called RELOCATION REGISTER. The value in relocation register is added to every address generated by a user process. Example : Reloacation register is 14000 if program tries to access the address 0 it is dynamically relocated to 14000 if the program tries to access 334 then it is reloacated in 14334.

THE USER NEVER ACCESSES the real PHysIcAL Adresses. User program deals with logical address.
